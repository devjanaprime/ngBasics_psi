NG Basics
===

- set up basic project (NEA)
- src files
- create "myApp" (ng app) and link to html
- create a controller and link to div in html
- create ```var vm``` which will refer to our controller
- create & text ```ng-click``` to handle click events
- connect input fields via ```ng-model```
- create a ```vm.ARRAYNAME``` which will hold our items
- push items from the input fields into the array when a button is clicked
- display items on DOM with ```ng-repeat```
